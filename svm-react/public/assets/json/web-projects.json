I have written this with a simple purpose: make my secondary screen black when not used. I wanted a simple way to do this without interacting with the monitor itself. I decided to add an all-white screen function to control the localized monitor lighting for webcam communications. No need for a separate lighting solution, as I already have giant monitors that can produce light."
