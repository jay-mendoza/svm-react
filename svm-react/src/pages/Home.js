I spent years getting my degrees in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Computer Engineering</a>. I am trained and educated to deal with electronics, software, hardware, and everything in between â€” although I never really got these to good use, as I have been doing software engineering for the entirety of my career.

                    Software-wise, I do full-stack, but I am especially gifted with front-end development. I would like the opportunity to work on other things as well, like embedded systems and mobile if given the chance. Aside from Technology, the automotive and aerospace industries interest me the most.
